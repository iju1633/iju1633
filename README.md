👋 Hi, I am currently attending the University of Seoul, majoring in computer science.  
🌐 I am currently acting as the lead of the 2022-2023 UOS GDSC, leading 37 people.  
💻 I love to apply theories through team/individual projects and receive PR reviews from developers to build practical sense.  
😆 I try to expose myself to an environment that constantly motivates me.  
👀 If you want to know more about me, please refer to my portfolio.
