👋 Hi, I am currently attending the University of Seoul, majoring in computer science.  
🌐 I served as the leader of the 2022-2023 UOS GDSC, a 37-member IT community.  
😆 I try to expose myself to an environment that constantly motivates me.  
👀 If you want to know more about me, please refer to my portfolios.
